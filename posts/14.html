			<p>
				With the development of media industry and especially because of a blazingly growing the quantity of digital information,I wanted to become more media literate and also summon others to do same thing.
				Presently, I can surely say that I achieved that level, where my Media Literacy is good. Moreover, I am going to provide information about how I became media literate in such
				points and concepts as Social Media, Privacy, Media Content, Worldview and Entertainment.
				<br><br>
				Previously, for many years, quality of my media literacy was awful. For example, let is take the field of social media, it was absolutaly normal that I spend three-four hours scrolling Instagram every day,
				and almost same situation was with other social platforms. Also, I spent approximately ten hours using my mobile phone. I also I was wasting my time to play games. I even reached the limit on the number of chats in Telegram,
				which is 500, because I was subscribed on plenty of channels with entertaining content. If I am talking about privacy, my knowledge also was afwul, because I made a lot of mistakes at that time such as unreliable passwords,
				sharing private information on social networks and downloading programs from dangerous sources which has probability to be malware. Moreover, I was heavily involved to 'Doom Scrolling' at the beginning of Russia-Ukraine war in February 2022.
				If you never heard about 'Doom Scrolling' before, so this is the activity of spending a lot of time looking at your phone or computer and reading bad or negative news stories, and many experts and scientists say that it can harm to your mental health.
				<br><br>
				Currently, after many years, state of my media literacy became strongly better but I still improving it. For instance, quantity of time which I wasting for social networks was greatly reduced and nowadays,
				I spend approx four hours for all social networks combined. If earlier my Instagram account has more than a thousand subscriptions, now I created another profile when I subscribed only my friends and siblings and that led to the fact that I visit Instagram very rarely.
				A lot of work has been done in Telegram because of it is a main platform to communicate with others for me. I decided to carry out cleaning by unsubscribe hundreds of news and entertainment channels. I think that reading a lot of news
				every day is not good because these news quickly becomes unnecessary and loses value after a while. Moreover, if a news channel quickly publishes news at the time of some events, then there is a high probability of publishing fake news or unverified.
				Also, I have improved my skills in security perfectly and became more careful on the global network. If earlier my YouTube subscriptions was more about entertainment, now they are more about study and content about Computer Science.
				<br><br>
				I almost stopped reading world news, especially political news, except IT news, because in my opinion, it is a very good approach to make your life and mental health better simply because you avoid negative news and avoid filling the brain with unnecessary information.
				Also, I got a little interested in the topic of stoicism.
				<br><br>
				In conclusion, I strongly recommend everyone (and especially the younger generation) to try my method, because nowadays it is important to be media literate.
