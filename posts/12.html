				let me clarify my situation and give more details. my default terminal-based editor is micro[1] and I like it.
				however, performance isn't good and I consider helix-editor[2] is more smooth and fast. I think this is because micro is written in golang,
				while helix is written in rust, but it's simply my assumption.
				<br><br>
				if u ask me why I like micro ? my simple answer is that this editor is so simple and not overrated. especially, not overrated with keybindings.
				<br><br>
				I ain't fun of vim-like[3] navigation. it seems too complicated for me. of course, I understand that this type of navigation is very good thing for most people,
				but not for me simply because it's complicated and it's hard to keep in mind these keybindings. I accept opinion that with having skills in vim-navigation,
				developer can better edit code, but minimalism and simplicity is important for me in editing. I ain't gonna dissuade you from using vim or whatever else in this text.
				I just describe my own experience with these terminal-based editors.
				<br><br>
				micro is good because u just edit without switching mode like in vim-like navigation (helix based on vim-navigation). moreover,
				I often use clipboard during editing code. for example, if I wanna paste something to clipboard in micro, I just hold down "shift",
				select necessary text with arrows and then I just "ctrl-c". meanwhile in helix, u'll have to switch to select mode from insert mode and
				then use hotkey and it's so inconvenient. however, fortunately we're able to change keymap and customize for yourself what pleases me.
				<br><br>
				if I can set up and get used to helix-editor, most likely, helix will become my default editor because of itself good performance which is also can be called as blazingly fast))
